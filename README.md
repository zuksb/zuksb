## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Zuks

I'm currently studying **Python programming** and focusing on building a solid foundation in logic, computer theory, and gradual practice.

## 🧠 What I'm studying
- Python (fundamentals)
- Programming logic
- Basic data structures
- How computers work (theoretical concepts)
- A little math applied to programming

## 🛠️ What you will find here
- Study exercises
- Small projects in Python
- Tests, experiments, and simple code
- Repositories used as learning notebooks

Nothing here is a “final product.” It's a process.

## 🎯 Objective
To learn programming consistently, understanding **why things work the way they do**, not just copying code.

## 📚 In progress
- Continuous, non-linear study
- Weekly practice with small projects
- Frequent reviews of concepts learned
